     <h1> Digital diary book </h1>
    <h2> I designed this web for myself to keep all of my data and bio together. </h2>
    <p class="p1"> I am Dipesh Ghimire and I am 23 years old orignally from Nepal. I enjoy playing both the flute and the guitar, each in its own perfect setting. The flute feels most alive when I play it in the quiet hills, where the wind and open sky make every note softer and more peaceful. The guitar, on the other hand, feels right in a place full of ambience—warm lights, calm surroundings, and a mood that lets every chord echo beautifully. </p><img src = "C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Desktop\dg\IMG_2919.JPG" alt = "my photo" style =" width:200px; margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom:20px;" >
